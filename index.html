       <div>In recent years, sustainability has become a crucial element in the field of architecture. As the global community faces environmental challenges, architects are increasingly focusing on creating buildings that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing but also environmentally responsible. The need to reduce carbon footprints and conserve natural resources is driving this shift.</div>
       <div>Below, I will explain why sustainability is essential in modern architecture:</div>
       <ol>
        <li>
            <div class="negrita">Reduction of environmental impact</div>
            Sustainable architecture aims to minimize environmental damage by using eco-friendly materials and construction methods that prioritize energy efficiency. Reducing CO2 emissions and conserving resources are critical in combating climate change.</li>
        <li>
            <div class="negrita">Efficient and adaptive design</div>
            Sustainable buildings are designed to adapt to their surroundings, making optimal use of natural light and ventilation. This reduces the reliance on artificial heating, cooling, and lighting systems, leading to significant energy savings.
        </li>
        <li> 
            <div class="negrita">Use of recycled and renewable materials</div>
            The incorporation of recycled and renewable materials, such as bamboo, certified wood, and recycled concrete, is a growing trend in sustainable architecture. These materials help reduce the depletion of natural resources and decrease waste in construction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="negrita">Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources</div>
            Integrating renewable energy systems, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal energy, is one of the most effective strategies for achieving sustainability. Energy efficiency becomes a core design principle, ensuring lower and cleaner energy consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="negrita">Lifecycle-oriented building design</div>
            Sustainable architecture encompasses the entire lifecycle of a building, from construction to eventual demolition. The goal is to maximize durability and minimize resource use over time, promoting the reuse and recycling of materials.
        </li>
    </ol>
       <p>Modern architecture faces the challenge of creating structures that meet human needs while respecting and protecting the environment. Sustainability is not just a trend but a responsibility that will shape the future of construction</p>
